\chapter{Interaction Structures}
\label{chp:interaction-structures}

We have seen that what we really want is a number of different languages.  So
far we have specified these by hand, but there is actually both a system to how
they are defined from basic operations, and how they relate to each other.  In
this chapter we introduce interaction structures which allow us to specify the
set of operations and the operations players provide to each other explicitly.
