\chapter{Finite Sets}

For working with probabilities, it is often useful to be able to create a
uniform distribution over the sets we are working with.  To do this, the set in
question must be finite.  Here we can briefly present how we can encode
finiteness.  Most can be take from existing work:~\cite{finitesets}
