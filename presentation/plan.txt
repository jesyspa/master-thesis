I want to cover the following topics:
* Games in cryptography
* Curry-Howard, BHK, and propositions-as-types
* Dependent types
* Free monads as a syntax for games
* A syntactic relation on games
* As an aside: models for this relation
* Indexed monads for stricter control
* As another aside: command structures
* Interesting but not very relevant:
    - Command structures form a category
    - So do indexed monads, in many ways
    - The category of indexed monads has some cool structure.
