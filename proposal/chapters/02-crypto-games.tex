\section{Formal Definition}

A game is always parametrised by two things: a scheme and an adversary.  It defines, using a sequence of interactions, a
relation 

A game is a procedure describing a sequence of interactions with an adversary, concluding in an event that indicates
whether the adversary wins or loses the game.

An adversary is an algorithm that the game is parametrised over.
